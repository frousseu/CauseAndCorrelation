Vanishing Tetrads Algorithm
}
\description{
For each unique set of four variables in the input data, this function tests if these four variables possess "vanishing" tetrads.  A tetrad is a product of two correlations that exactly equals a second product of two correlations, each  involving the same four variables.  Each set of four variables has three possible tetrad equations (tetrad triplets). If a tetrad vanishes, but every variable of the four is dependent on every other, conditional on every possible set of the other variables, then there must be a latent variable generating these correlations.  This is the Tetrad Representation Theorem whose proof is given in Spirtes et al. (1993), page 196-197.

\usage{
vanishing.tetrads(dat, sig = 0.05)
}

\arguments{
  \item{dat}{a matrix or data frame containing only numeric values}
  \item{sig}{the asymptotic significance level for testing the equality of the tetrad components}
}
\details{
The test assumes multivariate normality and linearity.  It is also an asymptotic test and so is biased in small samples.  
}
\value{
Each unique tetrad is tested and the outcome given along with the null probability.
